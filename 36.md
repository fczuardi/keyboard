# ZuFa-min (beta)

Zuardi's familiar layout for minimal keyboards.

ZuFa-min is an open source keyboard layout for people who wants to try a minimal
keyboard (34+ keys), but don't want to relearn everything.

## Features

- Familiarity:
  - QWERTY layout for letters
  - 12345 row for numbers (Layer 1) and their symbols (Layer 2), instead of Numpad
  - Extra layers (3 and 4) to ease the muscle memory transition (from pinky to thumb) for Bksp, Enter, Esc and Tab
- Confort:
  - Modifiers on home row: Ctrl, Ralt(Compose), Super, and Alt
    - f, d, s and g (left)
    - j, k, l and h (right)
- Quality of life
  - Vim hjkl as arrow keys (Layer 1)
  - ' on the base layer, to the right of L (inspired by the Miryoku layout)
  - Browser Tab navigation using hl (Layer 2, shortcut for Ctrl+PgUp/Down)
  - NO CAPSLOCK (hold your shift on the thumbs to shout)
  - Key Overrides for common i3 Super+`<number>`
  - Combos for accented letters such as: `'`+`<letter>` for áéíóú
    - Brazil mentioned?
- Room for growth
  - many empty slots still, you can use it to remix according to your particular needs
    - for example, I didnt included Home, End, and PrintScreen or dedicated copy/paste, or rgb and media buttons...

## Manual

## Thumb Cluster

- Two spaces, one for each thumb
  - that acts as Shift when holded
- Exclusive buttons for layer modifiers
  - left thumb = Layer 1 activation
  - right thumb = Layer 2 activation (Layer1 with Shift)
- Bcksp and Esc can be triggered using both thumbs depending on which thumb presses first:
  - left,right = Bksp
  - right,left = Esc
- Outermost thumb buttons (optional, 36+ keys)
  - Tab and Enter when tapped
  - Layers 3 and 4 when holded (f-keys, mouse and forward Del)

### Redundancy

- The outermost thumb buttons can be discarded on a 34 keys layout
    - Layers 3 and 4 can be replaced with Layer 5 (Layers 3+4) on the right thumb
    - and use left thumb to hold two buttons to achieve the same of Layer 2

## Combos
    - `,`+`<letter>` for ç,ã,õ
    - `'`+`<letter>` for á,é,í,ó,ú
    - `y`+`<letter>` for âêô
    - `.`+`a` for à

## Key Overrides

Feel free to disable them if they are not useful for your setup.

### Vim:

- switch to alternate file
  - ctrl+y have been remaped to ctrl+6
- fix for shift+d triggering operation pending mode
  - suppress ralt when Rshif is pressed with RALT_T(KC_D)

### i3:

- switch to workspace number x:
  - Left
    - LGui+q = LGui+1
    - LGui+w = LGui+2
    - LGui+e = LGui+3
  - Right
    - LGui+y = LGui+6
    - LGui+u = LGui+7
    - LGui+i = LGui+8
    - LGui+o = LGui+9

### Ralt as Compose on Linux:

We already have combos for many things that ralt as compose key does,
but if the muscle memory is stronger, here are overrides to prevent the use
of multiple fingers:

- ralt+a = ralt+~
- ralt+s = ralt+`
- ralt+y = ralt+^


## Changelog

- Jun 06 - `v0.1.0`: Initial beta release

## Issues?
- home row modifiers have some drawbacks, what I havent been able to figure out yet:
  - holding k or j to go up and down in vim normal mode is not possible (and this might be a good thing)
    - one workaround though is to tap and hold, like running on a videogame
