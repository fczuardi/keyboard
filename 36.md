# ZuFa-min (beta)

Zuardi's familiar layout for minimal keyboards.

ZuFa-min is an open source keyboard layout for people who wants to try a minimal
keyboard (34+ keys), but don't want to relearn everything.

## Features

- Familiarity:
  - QWERTY layout for letters
  - 12345 row for numbers and their symbols (Layer 1 for left and 2 for right), instead of Numpad
  - * an extra layer (Layer 3) to ease the muscle memory transition (from pinky to thumb) for Bksp, Enter, Esc and Tab
    - *: (if on 36+ keys)
- Confort:
  - Shift on thumbs
  - Modifiers on home row: Ctrl, Alt, Super and Ralt(Compose)
    - f, d, s and g (left)
    - j, k, l and h (right)
- Quality of life
  - Vim hjkl as arrow keys (Layer 1)
  - ' on the base layer, to the right of L (inspired by the Miryoku layout)
  - Browser Tab navigation using `n` and `m` (Layer 2, shortcut for Ctrl+PgUp/Down)
  - Key Overrides for common i3 Super+`<number>`
  - Combos for accented letters such as: `'`+`<letter>` for áéíóú
    - Brazil mentioned?
  - NO CAPSLOCK (hold your shift on the thumbs to shout)

## Manual

## Thumb Cluster

- Backspace and Space on the base layer
  - that acts as Shift when holded
- Exclusive buttons for layer modifiers
  - right thumb = Layer 1 activation
  - left thumb = Layer 2 activation
- Outermost thumb buttons (optional, 36+ keys)
  - Layers 3 when holded (pink layer with familiar  esc, tab, bksp and enter)
  - Esc and Enter when tapped

### Redundancy

The outermost thumb buttons can be discarded on a 34 keys layout

## Combos (optional)

Ralt as compose key is supported on this layout, so if you just want to keep using
what you already know it's fine. But if you want to try two keys combos instead,
here is a list of recommended chord-triggered macros:

    - `,`+`<letter>` for ç,ã
      - `c`+`o` for õ (c is mirror of ,)
    - `'`+`<letter>` for á,é
      - `a`+`<letter>` for í,ó,ú (a is mirror of ')
    - `.`+<letter>` for â,ê
      - `x`+`o` for ô (x as mirror of .)
    - `/`+`a` for à

## Key Overrides (optional)

Feel free to disable them if they are not useful for your setup.

### Vim:

- switch to alternate file
  - ctrl+y have been remaped to ctrl+6
- fix for shift+d triggering operation pending mode
  - suppress ralt when Rshif is pressed with LALT_T(KC_D)

### i3:

- switch to workspace number x:
  - Left
    - LGui+q = LGui+1
    - LGui+w = LGui+2
    - LGui+e = LGui+3
  - Right
    - LGui+y = LGui+6
    - LGui+u = LGui+7
    - LGui+i = LGui+8
    - LGui+o = LGui+9

### Ralt as Compose on Linux:

We already have combos for many things that ralt as compose key does,
but if the muscle memory is stronger, here are overrides to prevent the use
of multiple fingers:

- ralt+a = ralt+~
- ralt+s = ralt+`
- ralt+y = ralt+^


## Changelog

- Jun 09 - `v0.4.0`:
  - Lots of tweaks, simplified to only 3 layers, and assuming the use of two thum keys for typing symbols.
- Jun 09 - `v0.3.0`:
 - Del instead of Tab on the left distant thumb
 - moved Fx keys to the right and mouse to the left on the layer 5
 - dedicated Cut, Copy and Paste Buttons on layer 5
 - inclusion of Home and End on layer 5
- Jun 08 - `v0.2.0`:
  - ye yo for circumflex combos was not a good idea, words like yet kept triggering the macro.
    - changed the combo to be y+n+<letter>
  - moved pgup,pgdown,ctrlpgup,ctrpgdown from layer 2 to layer 1 to make layer 2 completely optional
    - replicated esc and tab from layer 2 on layer 5 so people on 34 keys can have the same nice esc with the thumb experience
- Jun 06 - `v0.1.0`: Initial beta release

## Issues?
- home row modifiers have some drawbacks, what I havent been able to figure out yet:
  - holding k or j to go up and down in vim normal mode is not possible (and this might be a good thing)
    - one workaround is to use layer 1, where hjkl are regular arrows
- accents combos could use more tweaking:
  - '+o for ó while logical, feels unconfortable, same goes for ,+o for õ and .+o for ô
    - the ideal would be to use a two hands chord, however the left side contains lots of common letters tha are used with `o` already :(
    - I am experimenting c+o for õ since v0.4.0  use q+o for õ and z+o for ô that are the most unconfortable in the previous combo, maintaining the odd '+o for ó for the sake of discoverability for now.
